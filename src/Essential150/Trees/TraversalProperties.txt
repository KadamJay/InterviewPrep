Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals provide different perspectives on the structure and arrangement of nodes in a binary tree.

1. Preorder Perspective:
   - Preorder traversal gives a "top-down" or "parent-first" perspective.
   - The root node is visited first, followed by its left subtree and then its right subtree.
   - It is useful for creating a copy of a tree, evaluating prefix expressions, and displaying the tree structure.

2. Inorder Perspective:
   - Inorder traversal gives a "left-root-right" perspective.
   - The left subtree is visited first, followed by the root node, and then the right subtree.
   - It is useful for obtaining nodes in sorted order for a binary search tree, performing binary tree operations, and expression evaluation.

3. Postorder Perspective:
   - Postorder traversal gives a "bottom-up" or "child-first" perspective.
   - The left subtree is visited first, followed by the right subtree, and then the root node.
   - It is useful for deleting a tree, evaluating postfix expressions, and performing certain mathematical calculations.

Each perspective provides unique insights into the relationships between nodes and their positions in the tree. 
The choice of traversal depends on the specific requirements of the problem or algorithm being implemented.
